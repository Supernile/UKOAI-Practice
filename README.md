# UKOAI-Practice
A set of artificial intelligence models created as training for the UK Olympiad in AI. These were originally made and run in Google Collab but have been modified to run on a normal python compiler. For each, we generate an initial accuracy and an accuracy after training. If the model works, this second value should be smaller than the former.
